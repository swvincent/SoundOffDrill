# SoundOffDrill

This was planned to be a computerized blending drill inspired by the Orton-Gillingham approach to reading instruction. I never finished it and have no plans to pick it back up.

It was being developed in conjunction with my wife Doris L. Vincent, M.S. CCC-SLP who is trained in the Orton-Gillingham approach. She found something else that worked so I moved on to other projects :-)
