# SoundOffDrill

This is a computerized blending drill inspired by the Orton-Gillingham approach to reading instruction. It is still a work in progress.

It is developed in conjunction with my wife Doris L. Vincent, M.S. CCC-SLP who is trained in the Orton-Gillingham approach.

More information will be available on my website when the project is released.
